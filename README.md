# Challenge

  Hi! First of all thank you for the opportunity given to me to take this test. This is a oportunity very important to me and i'll give my best to make it happen. Thank you very much!
  I took all of last Sunday(05/03) to perform the test, and right now Tuesday(07/05) I write this readme.
  I did something very simple so as not to take longer in delivery. The idea is to share a bit of the architecture I used. Because it is something small, a test, many things cannot be presented, as it ends up being "Too much for too little". I could implement several things like docker, gitflow, ci/cd, libraries to facilitate the code, but I didn't see the need.
  The idea is to deliver and be able to have a nice conversation with you about the project itself and many other things.
  
  Lucas.
